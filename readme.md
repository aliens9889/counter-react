# Counter React

This Counter project will have some variation on how is going to be built.

The base part of the project is that will be coded with React.js also using dependencies like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).

I considerate this project good to understand better the idea how to work with redux. Because to be honest at first I got lost a lot. And I'm doing this to keep the knowledge that already have, also I hope this will help someone who is starting with React.

And to make it more fun I will do the same project in different ways, keeping the base parts and adding the new ones.

The concept the projec is this, you will have 4 buttons where each one do a different action for the counter, the four options you will have are:

```
Increment (+1)
Decrement (-1)
Add (+10)
Subtract (-15)
```

This project is inspired on the Udemy Course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) I learned a lot! from this course, if you have the opportunity to do it. I recommend it!

On the projects I will use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to add and install dependencies. If you don't want to use yarn, not problem, feel free to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for adding or installing dependencies.
