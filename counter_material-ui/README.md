This Counter will have the base parts as I mencioned in the root readme.

The new dependency that I installed on this project was [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) You can get more info about the elements I will add on the project.

To make the project works first you have to install the dependencies
```
yarn install
```

Once you have all dependencies installed, you can run the project with this command
```
