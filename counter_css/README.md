# Counter CSS

Hi everyone this is the same counter I've been building before, but this time I'm using css only for the style part, beside another thing this one has different from the other counters is the way you can change the theme of the counter,also it is my first time using **flex** to display the result so it was insteresting to building this project.

I added a loader spinner from this page check check [here](https://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/).

The depencies are the same
```
redux
redux-thunk
react-redux
```
